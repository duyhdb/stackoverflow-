## General info
This tool is a part of project I learnt about crawler.

## Technologies
Project is created with:
* Python version: 3.8.10
* Stack Exchange API version: 2.3

[Learn more](https://api.stackexchange.com/docs/) about latest API version.

## Requirement
* `stackoverflow API key` store in config file (i.e. `myconfig.cfg`) located in the same directory of this script.

As document said, an API key is NOT compulsory to retrieve question/answer, but for more API quota in this case.
> If an application does have an access_token, then the application is on a distinct user/app pair daily quota (default [size of 10,000](https://api.stackexchange.com/docs/throttle)).

[Register an API key](https://stackapps.com/apps/oauth/register).
